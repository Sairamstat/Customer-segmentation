A customer segmentation project in Python involves dividing a company's customer base into distinct groups based on certain characteristics or behaviors. This helps businesses tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences more effectively. In Python, you would typically use data analysis and machine learning techniques to perform customer segmentation. This could involve methods like clustering (K-means, hierarchical clustering) or dimensionality reduction (PCA), along with data visualization libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to interpret and present the results. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights about customer preferences, behaviors, and needs to enhance business decision-making.
